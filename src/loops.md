# ** FOR STATEMENT: **
The for loops is more complex to set up but s commonly used when you are iterating over a set of values
It repeatedly loops something until a condition is satisfied

```
for (init; expression; increment) {
     // block of statments
  }
``` 
These Parts are all optional and consist of the following 
* The initialization section declares or sets state, usually declaring and initializing a loop variable , before the loop begins processing.
* The expression section , once it becomes false, will end the loop processing
* The Increment section is execured after the expression is tested  , and is generally the place where the loop variable is incremented



# ** WHILE STATEMENT: **
The while loop executes until a specified condition becomes false

# ** DO WHILE STATEMENT : ** 
The do while always executes at least one and continues until a specified condition becomes false
